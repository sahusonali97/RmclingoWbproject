            Proficiency in English is a critical component of a successful modern society. English is the third most spoken and most widely taught language on the planet. Commonly used in over 100 countries by more than 300 million people as a first language and by over 600 million as a second language, English is a “global language,” the “lingua franca of the modern era.” English skills are necessary for any country to fully benefit from global commerce; access the latest science, technology, and innovation; and exert influence in the world. 
The two main English language proficiency tests accepted at universities across the world are the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Achieving a particular score on one of these tests could help you study in English at the institution of your choice, so it can be an essential part of the studying abroad process.
